# CSE-3313-HW04
This is the coding assignment for Homework 4 for CSE3313 (Introduction to Signal Processing).
There are 2 coding assignment questions for this hw, the first is **Design of Lowpass and Highpass FIR filters** and the second is **Image Processing** using these filters

## Purpose for first coding question
Learn how to produce the filter coefficients needed to construction lowpass and
highpass filters.

That is, a common signal processing task is to remove the components of a signal whose frequency
is outside a particular range. A lowpass filter removes the components whose frequency is
higher than a certain cut-off frequency while a highpass filter removes the components whose
frequency is below a certain cut-off frequency.

### Process for first coding question
* First we design a low-pass filter with the following specifications
  - A cut-frequency of f<sub>c</sub> = 50 Hz
  - Filter length of L = 21, and M = filter length - 1
  - 0 <= n < L
